# `armv7a-none-eabi` and `armv7a-none-eabihf`

**Tier: 2** for `armv7a-none-eabi`
**Tier: 3** for `armv7a-none-eabihf`

Bare-metal target for CPUs in the Armv7-A architecture family, supporting
dual ARM/Thumb mode, with ARM mode as the default.

Note, this is for processors running in AArch32 mode. For the AArch64 mode
added in Armv8-A, see [`aarch64-unknown-none`](aarch64-unknown-none.md) instead.

Processors in this family include the [Arm Cortex-A5, 8, 32, etc][cortex-a].

See [`arm-none-eabi`](arm-none-eabi.md) for information applicable to all
`arm-none-eabi` targets.

## Requirements

All Armv7-A processors include an FPU (a VFPv3 or a VFPv4). The difference
between the `-eabi` and `-eabihf` targets is whether the FPU is used for
passing function arguments. You may prefer the `-eabi` soft-float target when 

When using the hardfloat targets, the minimum floating-point features assumed
are those of the `vfpv3-d16`, which includes single- and double-precision,
with 16 double-precision registers. This floating-point unit appears in
Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A8 processors. See [VFP in the Cortex-A processors][vfp]
for more details on the possible FPU variants.

If your processor supports a different set of floating-point features than the
default expectations of `vfpv3-d16`, then these should also be enabled or
disabled as needed with `-C target-feature=(+/-)`.

## Start-up and Low-Level Code

The [Rust Embedded Devices Working Group Arm Team] maintain the [`cortex-ar`]
and [`cortex-a-rt`] crates, which may be useful for writing bare-metal code
using this target. Those crates include several examples which run in QEMU and
build using these targets.
